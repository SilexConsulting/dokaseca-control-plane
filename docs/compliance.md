DoKa Seca implements a comprehensive compliance framework using [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) for policy enforcement and [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) for supply chain security. This combination provides automated policy validation, resource mutation, and container image signing to ensure workloads meet security and compliance requirements throughout the platform lifecycle.
