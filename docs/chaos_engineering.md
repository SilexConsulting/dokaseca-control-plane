# Chaos Engineering

DoKa Seca provides comprehensive chaos engineering capabilities to help teams build resilient cloud-native applications
and validate system reliability through controlled failure injection. The platform integrates with industry-leading chaos
engineering tools to enable systematic resilience testing.

## Overview

Chaos engineering is the practice of experimenting on a system to build confidence in its capability to withstand turbulent
conditions in production. DoKa Seca implements chaos engineering through two powerful platforms:

- **[Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/)** - Cloud-native chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes
- **[Litmus](https://litmuschaos.io/)** - Open-source chaos engineering framework

These tools enable teams to proactively identify weaknesses in their systems before they manifest as outages in production.

## Chaos Engineering Principles

DoKa Seca's chaos engineering implementation follows core principles:

1. **Hypothesis-Driven**: Define clear hypotheses about system behavior under failure conditions
2. **Production-Safe**: Minimize blast radius and impact on real users
3. **Automated**: Integrate chaos experiments into CI/CD pipelines
4. **Measurable**: Monitor system behavior and collect meaningful metrics
5. **Gradual**: Start with small experiments and gradually increase complexity

## Chaos Mesh Integration

[Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/) is DoKa Seca's primary chaos engineering platform, providing a rich set of fault
injection capabilities specifically designed for Kubernetes environments.

### Key Features

- **Native Kubernetes Integration**: Chaos experiments defined as Kubernetes CRDs

- **Observability**: Integration with monitoring systems for experiment tracking

### Supported Chaos Experiments

#### Pod Chaos

- **PodKill**: Randomly kill pods to test recovery mechanisms
- **PodFailure**: Make pods fail for specified durations
- **Container Kill**: Target specific containers within pods

#### Network Chaos

- **Network Partition**: Simulate network splits and partitions
- **Network Delay**: Introduce network latency
- **Network Loss**: Simulate packet loss
- **Network Corrupt**: Corrupt network packets
- **Bandwidth Limit**: Restrict network bandwidth

#### Stress Testing

- **Stress CPU**: Generate CPU load on target pods
- **Stress Memory**: Consume memory resources
- **Stress IO**: Generate disk I/O stress

#### Time Chaos

- **Time Skew**: Modify system time on target pods
- **Clock Drift**: Simulate clock synchronization issues

## DoKa Seca Implementation

### Installation and Setup

DoKa Seca includes both Chaos Mesh and Litmus as optional components that can be enabled during platform bootstrap by configuring Terraform variables:

```hcl
# terraform/tfvars/dev.tfvars
enable_chaos_mesh = true
enable_litmus = true
```

### Integration with Platform Components

#### GitOps Integration
